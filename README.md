# DSP48A1 Slice for Xilinx Spartan-6

This project implements a **DSP48A1 slice** for Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGAs using **Verilog HDL**, optimized for high-performance digital signal processing tasks such as multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, filtering, and FFTs.  
The DSP48A1 is a dedicated arithmetic block capable of handling fast multiplication, addition, accumulation, and other DSP-related operations.

## Features
- Parameterized DSP48A1 slice implementation.
- Supports synchronous and asynchronous resets.
- Implements:
  - 18x18 high-speed multiplication  
  - Addition & subtraction  
  - Accumulation with pipeline registers  
  - Flexible input multiplexing (A, B, C, D, OPMODE, Carry)  
  - Cascade and direct input modes for B port  
  - Carry-in/out with configurable source selection  
- Fully synthesizable Verilog HDL.  
- Modular design with reusable submodules.  
- Testbench included for functional verification.

## Getting Started
To work with this project, you’ll need a Verilog simulator. **QuestaSim** is recommended.

### 1. Quick Simulation (Recommended)
A preconfigured script `run_dsp.do` is provided to automate the simulation.

**Steps:**
1. Ensure your simulator is installed and licensed.  
2. Open a terminal or simulator console.  
3. Navigate to the project directory.  
4. Run:  
   ```tcl
   do run.do
