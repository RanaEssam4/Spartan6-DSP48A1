# Spartan6-DSP48A1 

This project implements a **DSP48A1 slice** for Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGAs using **Verilog HDL**, optimized for high-performance digital signal processing tasks such as multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, filtering, and FFTs.  
The DSP48A1 is a dedicated arithmetic block capable of handling fast multiplication, addition, accumulation, and other DSP-related operations.

## Reference
 - This design is based on the DSP48A1 documentation and guidlines from AMD : https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/ug389

## Getting Started
To work with this project, you‚Äôll need a Verilog simulator. **QuestaSim** is recommended.

### 1. Quick Simulation (Recommended)
A preconfigured script `run.do` is provided to automate the simulation.

**Steps:**
1. Ensure your simulator is installed and licensed.  
2. Open a terminal or simulator console.  
3. Navigate to the project directory.  
4. Run:  
   ```tcl
   do run.do
