# Spartan6-DSP48A1
This project implements a DSP48A1 slice for Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGAs using Verilog HDL, optimized for high-performance digital signal processing tasks such as multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, filtering, and FFTs.
The DSP48A1 is a dedicated arithmetic block capable of handling fast multiplication, addition, accumulation, and other DSP-related operations.

Features
Parameterized DSP48A1 slice implementation.
Supports synchronous and asynchronous resets.
Implements:
18x18 high-speed multiplication
Addition & subtraction
Accumulation with pipeline registers
Flexible input multiplexing (A, B, C, D, OPMODE, Carry)
Cascade and direct input modes for B port
Carry-in/out with configurable source selection
Fully synthesizable Verilog HDL.
Modular design with reusable submodules.
Testbench included for functional verification.

Getting Started
To work with this project, you’ll need a Verilog simulator. QuestaSim is recommended.

1. Quick Simulation (Recommended)
A preconfigured script run_dsp.do is provided to automate the simulation.

Steps:

Ensure your simulator is installed and licensed.
Open a terminal or simulator console.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run: do run_dsp.do
The script will:
Compile all Verilog files.
Load the testbench.
Run the simulation.
Display the waveform.
2. Manual Simulation (Optional)
Compile source files from src/.
Compile testbench files from tb/.
Load the top-level testbench (DSP48A1_tb).
Run the simulation and observe waveforms.
3. Testbench
The provided DSP48A1_tb.v contains example DSP48A1 operations.
Extend with custom vectors for more thorough testing.
